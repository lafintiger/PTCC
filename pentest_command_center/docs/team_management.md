{
    "id": "unique_identifier",
    "name": "Team Member Name",
    "email": "member@example.com",
    "role": "Team Lead",
    "skills": ["Network Scanning", "Exploitation", "Report Writing"],
    "access_level": "Administrator",
    "last_active": "2025-04-20 09:15:22",
    "date_added": "2025-03-15 14:30:00",
    "activities": [
        {
            "timestamp": "2025-04-20 09:15:22",
            "action": "Network Scan",
            "details": "Performed network scan on 192.168.1.0/24"
        }
        // More activities...
    ]
}
```

### Functions

The module implements the following key functions:

- `toggle_team_forms(action)`: Toggles visibility of forms based on selected action
- `add_team_member(name, email, role, skills, clearance)`: Creates a new team member
- `update_team_member(member_select, name, email, role, skills, clearance)`: Updates existing member
- `remove_team_member(member_select, reason, remove_data)`: Removes a team member
- `view_team_activity(member, date_range, activity_type)`: Displays filtered activity logs
- `update_member_details(member_select)`: Updates the member details display

## Integration Points

The Team Management module integrates with other modules in the following ways:

1. **Activity Logging**: Actions performed in other modules are logged in the team activity system
2. **Access Control**: User permissions set in Team Management determine available functionality
3. **Reporting**: Team information can be included in generated reports
4. **Accountability**: Actions in the system are attributed to specific team members

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the Team Management module include:

1. **Real-time Collaboration**: Chat and notification features
2. **Team Performance Metrics**: Analytics on team activity and contributions
3. **Project Assignment**: Assign team members to specific projects or clients
4. **Credential Management**: Secure sharing of credentials within teams
5. **Calendar Integration**: Schedule and coordinate team activities

## Usage Examples

### Managing a Penetration Testing Team

1. **Add specialized team members**:
   - Create profiles for network specialists, web app testers, social engineers, etc.
   - Assign appropriate skills and access levels

2. **Track project contributions**:
   - Monitor which team members performed scans, exploits, etc.
   - Review activity logs for comprehensive reports

3. **Maintain security**:
   - Remove team members when they leave projects
   - Adjust access levels as responsibilities change

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Duplicate Email Addresses**
   - Each team member must have a unique email address
   - System will warn if you attempt to add a duplicate

2. **Permission Problems**
   - Only administrators can add/remove team members
   - Check your access level if you cannot perform certain actions

3. **Missing Activity Logs**
   - Activities are only logged for actions performed within the application
   - External activities must be manually added through custom notes
