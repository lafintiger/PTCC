PenTest Command Center provides a unified web interface for various penetration testing tools with AI-powered analysis and assistance. It integrates network scanning, vulnerability scanning, OSINT tools, exploitation capabilities, and document analysis into a single, intuitive interface.

## Features

- **Network Scanning**: Scan networks and hosts using Nmap with visualizations
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Identify vulnerabilities using Nuclei and other scanners
- **OSINT Tools**: Gather information using TheHarvester, Shodan, and more
- **Exploitation**: Search and run Metasploit exploits
- **LLM Pen Testing**: Test and evaluate security of Large Language Models
- **Document Analysis**: Extract intelligence from network diagrams and technical documents
- **AI Assistant**: Get AI-powered analysis, recommendations and explanations
- **Report Generation**: Create comprehensive penetration testing reports

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Various penetration testing tools (Nmap, TheHarvester, etc.)
- Ollama for local AI model access
- Tesseract OCR for document image processing

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Ensure you have the following tools installed:
   - Nmap
   - Nuclei (optional)
   - TheHarvester (optional)
   - Metasploit Framework (optional)
   - Tesseract OCR (required for document analysis)

4. Install Tesseract OCR:
   ```
   # On Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
   
   # On macOS with Homebrew
   brew install tesseract
   
   # On Windows
   # Download and install from https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
   ```

5. Install Ollama from [https://ollama.ai/](https://ollama.ai/) and pull at least one model:
   ```
   ollama pull llama3
   ```

## Configuration

Configuration settings are stored in `config/settings.py`. You can override these settings by creating a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
# Server settings
HOST=127.0.0.1
PORT=7860

# API keys
SHODAN_API_KEY=your_shodan_api_key

# Ollama settings
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
OLLAMA_DEFAULT_MODEL=llama3
```

## Usage

Start the application:

```
python app.py
```

Then open your browser to http://127.0.0.1:7860

### Document Analysis

The Document Analysis tab allows you to extract valuable information from network diagrams, credentials documents, and other technical documentation:

1. **Upload Documents**
   - Supported formats: JPG, PNG, PDF
   - Add metadata (name, type, description, tags)
   - AI analysis extracts entities, technical details, and security insights

2. **Manage Documents**
   - Search and filter your document collection
   - View document details and extracted text
   - Re-analyze documents with AI
   - Delete documents

3. **Document Intelligence**
   - Query your documents using natural language
   - Ask questions like "What IP addresses are mentioned in the network diagrams?"
   - Get comprehensive answers with document references

Example use cases:
- Upload network diagrams to automatically identify network segments, devices, and potential security issues
- Extract credential information from documentation
- Identify security misconfigurations in technical documents
- Build a searchable knowledge base of technical documentation

## Modules

- **Network Scanner**: Scans networks and identifies hosts and services
- **Vulnerability Scanner**: Detects vulnerabilities in target systems
- **OSINT Scanner**: Gathers information from public sources
- **Exploit Manager**: Manages and executes exploit modules
- **LLM Security Tester**: Tests and evaluates LLM security and safety measures
- **Document Analyzer**: Extracts and analyzes text from images and PDFs
- **AI Assistant**: Provides AI-powered analysis and recommendations

### LLM Pen Testing

The LLM Pen Testing module allows for comprehensive security assessment of Large Language Models deployed in your environment:

1. **Jailbreak Testing**
   - Test LLMs against various jailbreak techniques (DAN, STAN, DUDE, etc.)
   - Evaluate resistance to hypothetical scenarios and role-playing attacks
   - Identify vulnerabilities in content filtering mechanisms

2. **Prompt Injection**
   - Test for susceptibility to instruction and context manipulation
   - Attempt system prompt extraction and leaking
   - Evaluate defense against adversarial inputs

3. **Data Extraction**
   - Test for training data leakage vulnerabilities
   - Probe for memorized content extraction
   - Assess privacy protection mechanisms

4. **Bypass Detection**
   - Test encoding tricks (Base64, ASCII art)
   - Evaluate detection of Unicode manipulation
   - Assess resistance to multi-language obfuscation

5. **Security Scanner**
   - Run comprehensive security assessments
   - Generate detailed vulnerability reports
   - Provide actionable remediation recommendations

Example use cases:
- Test company chatbots for security vulnerabilities
- Evaluate LLM content filtering effectiveness
- Ensure proper safeguards are in place before deployment
- Demonstrate risks of improperly secured AI systems

## Security Considerations

This tool is intended for authorized penetration testing only. Always:

1. Obtain proper authorization before scanning or testing any systems
2. Keep sensitive scan results secure
3. Follow responsible disclosure practices
4. Secure any uploaded documents that may contain sensitive information

## Disclaimer

This tool is for educational and authorized penetration testing purposes only. Unauthorized use against systems you don't own or have explicit permission to test is illegal and unethical.
